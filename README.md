# Summer Research Plans for the Rhagoletis research groups

## Start date: 2018-06-07
## End date: Ongoing

### Goals:

This repository is aimed to organize and coordinate projects among different institutions that study Rhagoletis. 

### Broad interests:

As a research team, we are interested in the diversity of life history strategies at the genetic, physiological, and phylogenetic level that lead to divergence in seasonal timing within the Rhagoletis study system.
