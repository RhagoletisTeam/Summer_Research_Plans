### Hahn lab summer research plan. Collect apple and hawthorn fruit in Grant and Lansing

**Major Question:** What are the types of physiological drivers of divergence in seasonal timing between host races of *Rhagoletis pomonella*?

**Hypothesis:** The differences in seasonal timing is due to or is related to divergence in biological rhythms. 

**Experimental approach:** Relate adult emergence, a proxy of seasonal timing, with biological rhythms measured in adults. 

**Previous work and preliminary data:**

In the previous year (2017), Dan and Andrew, with the help of Meredith, Greg, and Mac, collected apple and hawthorn fruit in Grant and Lansing sites:

Ferris and OG are Grant sites. 
MSU and Milford are Lansing sites. 

|Host  |Site_name | sample_size|
|:-----|:---------|-----------:|
|Apple |Ferris    |         472|
|Apple |Milford   |           2|
|Apple |MSU       |          17|
|Apple |OG        |         869|
|Haw   |Coll Hall |           6|
|Haw   |Ferris    |         369|
|Haw   |Milford   |          85|
|Haw   |OG        |           1|

Here is a summary table of the eclosion patterns for each host, organism, condition (rearing temp =RT, simulated overwintering = SO):

|Host  |organism |treatment | counts|
|:-----|:--------|:---------|------:|
|Apple |fly      |RT        |    197|
|Apple |fly      |SO        |    243|
|Apple |wasp     |RT        |      4|
|Apple |wasp     |SO        |      7|
|Haw   |fly      |RT        |     34|
|Haw   |fly      |SO        |     80|
|Haw   |wasp     |RT        |     20|
|Haw   |wasp     |SO        |      6|

Preliminary Adult emergence patterns between host races, for each organism and each treatment condition.

Note that the apple wasps sample sizes are low and the sample sizes in simulated overwintering is low. 

**Take Home**: It looks like wasps are synchronizing their adult emergence patterns based on temperature such that they emerge earlier under favorable(RT) conditions and emerge later under unfavorable conditions (SO). 

Here's another plot to get a sense of what the distributions actually look like with a violin plot:

**RT is more bimodal than SO, consistent with Dr. Feder's previous work**. 

OK, once the adults emerged, we measured their biological rhythms under entrainment(16L:8D to get them rhythmic) and free run (complete darkness = endogenous rhythm):

These are time series data with activity counts vs days. We analyzed these data with a spectral density analysis which identifies the dominant rhythms. 

Under RT in Haw, we identified divergence in rhythms under free run conditions:

All of the work can be accessed [here](https://github.com/adnguyen/Circadian_rhythm_runs_seasonal_timing).

**Additional preliminary analyses**

* We tested whether MR was related to adult emergence and we found pupae with low MR can eclose over the whole range from early to late. Ones with high MR tended to eclose earlier. This is at day 15.

(data are a bit old, but the pattern still remains)

* We tested whether there were any costs in terms of adult viability associated with pre-winter MR. 
    * With a negative binomial regression, we found those with high MR had lower lifespans under SO, but no difference under RT. 
    * with a survival analysis using a cox regression, we found that those with high MR also had a higher death rate under SO, but not under RT. 
    
**No diff in life span vs host races under RT**

**No diff in life span vs host races under RT**


**Future Plans**

In the future, we'd like to take expand on this project by:

1. Dissecting out further the relationship between host and parasitoids. This would involve
